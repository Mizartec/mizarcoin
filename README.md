Mining Reward
The MizarCoin network follows a meticulously planned reward system for its miners. 
Currently, miners are rewarded with 6000 new MizarCoins per block,  and this reward is subjected to a halving event approximately every 6 months,  or after every 262,800 blocks have been mined. 
This deliberate reduction in  block rewards ensures controlled supply.
In line with this strategy, the MizarCoin network is scheduled to produce a
total of 21 Billion MizarCoins, which is 100 times the number of currency
units compared to Bitcoin. This carefully designed supply model establishes   MizarCoin as a resilient and attractive digital currency, with ample availability
for users and investors. Join us as we shape the future of digital finance with
a thoughtfully planned ecosystem.

M-Scrypt
The M-Scrypt algorithm, in comparison to certain other encryption
algorithms such as SHA-256, exhibits greater resistance to ASIC
(Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) attacks. ASIC attacks are a form of  targeted attacks on specific encryption algorithms, where custom hardware
is employed to significantly boost the mining power, potentially
compromising security or accelerating cryptocurrency mining. Here are   some reasons contributing to M-Scrypt's resilience against ASIC attacks:
High Memory Requirements: The M-Scrypt algorithm was intentionally
designed with elevated memory requirements. This means that when
executing the M-Scrypt algorithm, a substantial amount of memory is
needed to store intermediate data and states. This complexity makes the design of ASICs more intricate and expensive, as they must incorporate   high-capacity memory chips, driving up costs.
Lower Parallelism: M-Scrypt, in contrast to algorithms like SHA-256, is less amenable to parallel processing. ASICs commonly depend on parallel
processing to enhance performance, but M-Scrypt's design hinders high
levels of parallelism. As a result, ASICs have a relatively smaller advantage in terms of performance when applied to the M-Scrypt algorithm.
Higher Complexity: The M-Scrypt algorithm involves more computational
steps and intricate operations, increasing the complexity of ASIC design and manufacturing. ASICs must support various operations and calculations,
making them more costly and adding to the difficulty of their design.
